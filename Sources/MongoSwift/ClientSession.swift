/**
 * A MongoDB client session.
 * This class represents a logical session used for ordering sequential operations.
 *
 * To create a client session, use `startSession` or `withSession` on a `MongoClient`.
 *
 * If `causalConsistency` is not set to `false` when starting a session, read and write operations that use the session
 * will be provided causal consistency guarantees depending on the read and write concerns used. Using "majority"
 * read and write preferences will provide the full set of guarantees. See
 * https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/read-isolation-consistency-recency/#sessions for more details.
 *
 * e.g.
 *   ```
 *   let opts = CollectionOptions(readConcern: ReadConcern(.majority), writeConcern: try WriteConcern(w: .majority))
 *   let collection = database.collection("mycoll", options: opts)
 *   try client.withSession { session in
 *       try collection.insertOne(["x": 1], session: session)
 *       try collection.find(["x": 1], session: session)
 *   }
 *   ```
 *
 * To disable causal consistency, set `causalConsistency` to `false` in the `ClientSessionOptions` passed in to either
 * `withSession` or `startSession`.
